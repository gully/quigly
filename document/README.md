This K2 inference project might result in a research note or two, or eventually a full-fledged publication.  [Research Notes of the AAS](http://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2515-5172) are short (<1000 words) publications with either 1 figure or 1 table.

## Document Possibilities
1. Inference of the K2 PSF
2. Inference of the K2 PSF with GPU acceleration
3. K2 Full Frame Image PSF Photometry
4. K2 Superstamp PSF Photometry
5. In-flight test of the K2 flat field
6. Mapping the PSF across the Kepler focal plane.
